      %p
        I decided to write Open Recipes when I got sick of trying to organize a pile of
        printed recipes that I had been collecting over the years. It was taking me
        too long to find what I was looking for. And often times, I wanted to find a recipe
        by something other than its title which meant the alphabetizing didn't help; I needed search.
        Once I got a smartphone, I thought it would be nice to be able to access my recipes
        on the go too. Clearly, the web was the answer.

      %p
        There were other options already out there, but none of them seemed to be quite what
        I was looking for. I wanted something simpler, faster, and accessible from any device.
        This is what I came up with.

        this site is under active development. I'll try not to break anything as 
        I add features, but it could happen. So, please chill out if something isn't
        working as expected. If you find something and think I won't notice it, open up an

        I wrote this site because I love cooking and web development. Try it out (for free)
        and let me know what you think.
