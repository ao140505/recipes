== Recipes

This is my second rails app. The purpose of it is to create a collection of recipes that 
I care about that are available on a web app such that I can quickly find something delicious
to cook. I hope to make this more convenient than keeping a binder full of print outs of recipes.

== Planned Features

good experience on a mobile device
search for recipes
taggable recipes
shopping list or the ability to send ingredients from recipe to another app
