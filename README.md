# Recipes [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/ao140505/recipes.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/ao140505/recipes)

The purpose of this app is for saving and sharing recipes. I used to keep all
 of my recipes in a binder that I alphabetized. That system worked for a while 
but I knew there had to be a better way; this is that better way.

## Planned Features

* good experience on multiple devices (responsive design)
* good search for recipes
* taggable recipes
* shopping list or the ability to send data to another shopping app
* ratings and reviews
* follow favorite contributors

## Getting Set Up

In addition to using bundler to get the dependancies for this app, you
need image magick. If you have homebrew you can get it by running:

```
brew install imagemagick --disable-openmp
```

## Bootstrap

Confused about what bootstrap is doing? Check out the source code:

```
bundle open bootstrap-sass
```
