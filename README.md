# Recipes

The purpose of this app is for saving and sharing recipes. I used to keep all
 of my recipes in a binder that I alphabetized. That system worked for a while 
but I knew there had to be a better way; this is that better way.

## Planned Features

* good experience on multiple devices (responsive design)
* good search for recipes
* taggable recipes
* shopping list or the ability to send data to another shopping app
* ratings and reviews
